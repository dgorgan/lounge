# lounge

The idea for this app was to allow users to sign up for an account, state what hobbies they're interested in, and discover other people and their hobbies.

Technologies used: Devise for effective and proven user registration, and bootstrap for the responsive grid system and basic typograhical/design aesthetics. 

Approach: Created ERDs, wrote user stories, and followed up with wireframes. Bootstrap in particular was very effective for rapid prototyping.

Installation: clone down git@github.com:dgorgan/lounge.git, run rake db:create, rake db:migrate, and rake db:seed, then run rails server and boot up localhost:3000 to view. 

Future deliverables: A messaging system between users, and i would also like to add a better tagging system as right now I have a default "lounger" tag set up for all users.
